Hello there!

I am a student of the University of Lucerne and I am currently taking a course in Data Mininig. This repository is used for my final capstone project of the course. The project is about the mining of data from Tripadvisor. I am using the Tripadvisor API to get the data. I am interested in the attractions of the Balearic island Formentera. I want to find out what the most popular attractions are with couples. 

This repository is structured als follows: 
The Scripts folder contains the scripts I used to mine, tidy and analyze the data.
The Visualizations folder contains the visualizations I created with the data.
The Output folder contains a markdown file with a short report of the project.

In the Traveller-App folder you find a shiny app that will allow you to explore the data interactively.

I hope you enjoy my project! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Caroline
